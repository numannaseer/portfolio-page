        <h3>Design & Maintenance</h3>
        <p>The goal is to design interfaces as per client's requirements
          by selecting color palettes
          which are appealing to the end-users and at the same time ensuring a user friendly structure
          with good user flow for the Responsive Websites.</p>
      <p> I use GitBash, Hyper CLI and GitKraken GUI for Local Version Control
          Management, and GitHub, an online platform for Remote Version Control Management.</p>
      <p>Considering maintenance an important aspect, from time to
          time after deployment, I check if my developed websites are responsive and bug-free. Verifying
          browser independence and handling user feedback is also a part of my maintenance phase. </p>
